            <h1> Michelle Gamble</h1>

            <p>Michelle Gamble was born on December 16th, 1999 in San Francisco, California. She is a senior at San Rafael High School and she is really excited about it because she is only taking five classes, three of which are Media Academy classes. Some of Michelle's hobbies include singing, playing guitar, listening to music, reading, and watching tv. Michelle has three younger sisters named Danielle, Ariel, and Carmel. She also has a cat whose name is technically Selina Kyle but her family just calls her Cat. Michelle's dad was born in the U.S., but her mom was born in Israel, so her family travels there every summer. One of Michelle's favorite quotes is,
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"A queen is never late. Everyone else is simply early." - Julie Andrews, Princess Diaries</p>
                </blockquote>
